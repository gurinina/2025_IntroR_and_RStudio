### Description
This repository is an adaptation of teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to R** workshop taught online [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/). The workshop introduces participants to the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. These materials are intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge and its application for increasing efficiency for data analysis. 

### Learning Objectives

1. **R syntax**: Familiarize the basic syntax and the use of Rstudio.
2. **Data types and data structures**: Describe frequently-used data types and data structures in R.
3. **Data inspection and wrangling**: Demonstrate the utilization of functions and indices to inspect and subset data from various data structures.
4. **Data visualization**: Apply the ggplot2 package to create plots for data visualization.
